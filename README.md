# Rust graphics library

I want the ui to be composed of individual special purpose widgets. That means a row should be a row and an image should be an image only for example. As opposed to html where anything can have any properties.  

I want to write this api in a way that I will switch to webgpu, vulkano or a more feature rich api once
I get the basics up and running. If that's even a good idea

## Goals

- Make it easy to build good looking and functional UI
- Producing readable code that doesn't feel like a pain to write
- Code must be descriptive ie the reader must be able to tell the layout of a page without seeing the output

I need to start doing these in order now

## Todo

- Figure out a layout system
- Add a colour struct
- Add proc macros for properties
- Add rounded corners
- Add interactions
- Add borders

## Ideas

For an on-hover, we keep all the bounds of the widgets in a hash map, then each frame we check
if the mouse position is one of the widgets then we call the function.
