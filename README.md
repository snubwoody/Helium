# Rust graphics library

I want the ui to be composed of individual special purpose widgets. That means a row should be a row and an image should be an image only for example. As opposed to html where anything can have any properties.

## Goals

- Make it easy to build good looking and functional UI
- Producing readable code that doesn't feel like a pain to write
- Code must be descriptive ie the reader must be able to tell the layout of a page without seeing the output

## TODO
- Add font rendering
- Add borders
- Add rounded corners
