//! This is the crate that manages all the helium layouts, at a basic level every layout
//! node must return a size and position so that other layouts can arrange themselves
//! accordingly.
//!
//! This layout engine is based on the idea that a [`Layout`] can only have one of three
//! different intrinsic sizes, known as [`BoxSizing`]
//! - It wants to be as large as possible, usually filling the parent, this is the
//! `BoxSizing::Flex(u8)` variant. It also has a flex factor which can be used to
//! control how much space it takes relative it's to sibling `Layouts`.
//! - It wants to be as small as possible, usually fitting it's children, this is the
//! `BoxSizing::Shrink` variant
//! - It wants to be a certain fixed size, this is the `BoxSizing::Fixed` variant.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```
//! use crystal::{EmptyLayout,HorizontalLayout,LayoutSolver,Size};
//!
//! let mut root = HorizontalLayout::new();
//! root.add_children([EmptyLayout::new(),EmptyLayout::new()]);
//!
//! // Pass in the root layout and the window size
//! // The layout solver returns any errors that occured, such as layout overflow
//! let _ = LayoutSolver::solve(&mut root,Size::new(500.0,500.0));
//! ```
